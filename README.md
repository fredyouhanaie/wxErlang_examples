# `wxErlang_examples`

These are a set of examples I have created while learning to use
`wxErlang`. It is hoped that others may benefit from the code snippets
provided here.

[`wxErlang`](https://erlang.org/doc/apps/wx/index.html) is the Erlang
bindings of the [`wxWidgets` GUI Library](https://www.wxwidgets.org/).

Each example is contained within a directory of its own. See the
corresponding README files for specific details and instructions.

## wxErlang Learning Resources

Here are some resources for starting with `wxErlang`.

### Tutorials

Arif Ishaq has produced a couple of very good tutorials. These can be
found [here](https://arifishaq.wordpress.com/).

If you're new to wxErlang, then these would be the best starting point
for you.

### wxErlang Documentation

`wxErlang` is part of the official Erlang/OTP software. The latest
documentation can be found
[here](https://erlang.org/doc/apps/wx/index.html).

These only describe the Erlang aspects of the library. In most cases
reference is made to the official `C++` documentation.

### wxWidgets Online Manual

The [wxWidgets Online Manual](https://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.0/)
contains all the details not mentioned in the wxErlang docs. Some
mental adjustment will be needed when skipping back and forth between
the Erlang and the C++ docs. However, this will not be a problem after
the initial familiarization.

Enjoy!
